# SS5G

This repository provides implementations of three deep learning models: DNN, LSTM, and GRU for server selection in 5G networks. The models aim to predict the optimal server based on network parameters, enhancing resource allocation and reducing latency. Each file is a self-contained jupyter notebook for training and evaluating its respective model. The dataset used includes network traffic data collected from video platforms and gaming applications. Users are encouraged to cite this work if it contributes to their research.
